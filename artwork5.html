        <h3><i>Digital Image</i>, 2018</h3>

        <p class="description">This art piece was created entirely in Adobe Photoshop. I was inspired to do this project by other people's work that was similar to a flat landscape. It was not that hard to create this piece because most of the tools
          that were used in Adobe Photoshop. Some outside sources were brought into this project like the birds, but other things like the mountains and the clouds were all created by me. The other thing that made this project complicated was that it
          required a lot of layers since the piece is supposed to show distance.
