      <h3><i>Digital Image</i>, 2020</h3>

      <p class="description"> Due to the Coronavirus pandemic the world is going through, I thought it would be interesting to make a movie poster. During quarantine, I have been watching a lot of movies and one of them was IT. This movie ultimately
        got me into the movie genre, horror, and currently, it is one of my favorite movies that I have seen to this day. Movie poster’s tasks are supposed to represent a film and draw the viewer’s interest to find out what the film is about. I
        wanted to recreate the original renderings of the movie posters because I thought they were very simple but the message and tone of the movie were clear. This project is not meant to bash on the artist's original renderings of the poster, it
        is meant to show other possibilities on what the poster could look like. There was a lot of negative space with the original posters so I wanted to take a different approach to it and fill the negative space and make the poster itself have
        that “wow” factor. Additionally, with all these changes by starting from scratch, I wanted to make sure that the movie poster’s message and tone for the film are still clear like the original. I experimented by grabbing images of the movie It
        on Google and used the layer mask tool to blend all of the pictures together. This piece was created all in Adobe Photoshop. Additionally, I took advantage of some of the filter effects to add smoke with the images to create an ominous scene.
