      <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
      <p class="exercise-description">This is the first sketch I have ever done in Processing, I have never done anything like this before and hopefully will continue to improve my skills in Processing. In this sketch, I learned numerous things to
        get me introduced to how Processing works. Some of those things that we were experimenting with were the basic drawing and color functions and learning the differences between active vs. static mode. I thought this piece was successful
        because it illustrated various concepts for this exercise whiles still having the image not being too messy. One thing I could improve on is my skills with the for loops, so I would not have to type out each code for each of the ellipses.

      <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
      <p class="exercise-description">In this sketch, I played around with the toggle logic with if statements and learned about the mouse and key events/properties. This exercise also introduced adding images into Processing and experimenting with
        Pfont class and relevant methods. The thing I found success with for this piece was being able to understand all of the mouse and key events/properties. One place of improvement could probably be understanding more about boolean logic
        options.

      <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
      <p class="exercise-description">In this sketch, I learned how to make custom functions with and without arguments. Played with the pushMatrix(), popMatrix(), translate, rotate and scale group of functions. Finally, I also created 2 different
        characters that were based on my functions and translation commands. The two characters I created in processing were definitely the most successful part of this exercise. Room for improvement can be adding more translations and movements with
        the two characters.

      <h2>Project 1</h2>
      <p class="exercise-description">For this project, I played around with 5 custom drawing functions: two of them being original and three of them that were used and modified from the drawing template. Additionally, with the custom drawing
        functions, I had to build upon my skills that were demonstrated with the previous 3 exercises. With the custom drawing functions, I created 10 drawings that were all themed to Christmas. The tools used for this project can be used for various
        subject matters and art styles. The drawings created with the functions were the most successful part of this project. One thing that could be improved is my drawing skills in processing because some of the images were very hard to draw with
        just a mouse.
