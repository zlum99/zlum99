        </center>
        Hello, my name is Zachary! I am a hard-working, self-driven, and dedicated student at San Jose State University studying Digital Media Art. Frequently praised as diligent by my peers, I can be relied upon to help achieve the goals of the
        position that I am designated to complete. Through my past work experiences, I have gained an understanding of time management, communication, organization, punctuality, and working under pressure. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with
        my friends and family, taking my dog on walks, and traveling. My ultimate goal throughout this whole experience is to learn and grow not just as a Digital Media Artist, but also as a person.

          <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        </center>
        All of my work that is presented to my audience is based on a digital experience. As a Digital Media Artist, I am still trying to process everything and learn more about myself. This means that I do not have a specific theme that is common
        rather than all of them being digital. Some of the works that I created inspired by my personal life. This allows me and my audience to find the art pieces more meaningful because it has a story along with it. Additionally, I enjoy creating
        work that other digital artists have done in the past, but then recreate them to fit my needs by adding a more personalized piece.
        <br></br>
        Some of the artworks that I have created are based on personal experiences in my life. One of the first projects that I created in my Art 74 class represented one of the few artworks that were inspired by my personal life and it was titled,
        “A Part of Me”. This piece represents everything I hold dear to me and what I would consider as a home for me. It illustrates various places that represent me like my church and where I grew up. I try to take photos with my phone camera to
        capture a specific moment and edit them to where it fulfills my needs for my project and how I envision it. I envisioned this piece to be either projected on a large screen or hung up on a wall. This piece will also have a description next to
        it like in a gallery to explain the importance of what is embedded in the work. Other artworks I create are inspired and based on other digital artists’ works. To make the works more interesting instead of copying other artists’ works I put
        my own personal touches to them to make them different and more original. A fun project I did was creating my version of the IT movie poster. There have been a lot of artist renderings for this specific movie. Having the internet accessible
        to digital media artists like me is an amazing tool that was not available in the past. This ultimately allowed me to collect source images from my laptop instead of physically getting images in real life.
        <br></br>
        Most of my works were created in Adobe Photoshop because it is the application I am the most comfortable and experienced with. The way I create my artworks is through the inspiration and guidance of other experienced people and tutorials.
        Through this, I am able to learn and gather the material and skillset I need in order to create my works in other various applications that I am not familiar with, for example, Premiere Pro, Audacity, Atom and Github. This website was created
        using HTML and CSS along with the use of Atom and Github.
        <br></br>
        The goal right now as a third-year Digital Media Art student is to gain more experience in the work industry and explore my different interests with my major. Currently, I am a Digital Media Content intern for #ICANHELP. My role is to plan
        and produce content for the company, this could be photos and/or videos. As an intern, I think of it as a great opportunity that allows me to gain more experience in the work industry and learn valuable skills that will help me in the future
        with my career.
