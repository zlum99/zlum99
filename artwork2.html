        <h3><i>Digital Image</i>, 2018</h3>

        <p class="description">This is a digital image that was created on Adobe Photoshop. The place I created is basically what I call home because each image represents something that I love dearly and that is near to my heart. The first image is
          Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Oahu and this is very important to me because my family tries to go to Hawaii at least once a year and when we do go to Oahu, we always visit Waikiki beach and make a bunch of memories every time we go. The second
          image on the right side of the piece is a picture of my church. That church is called First Chinese Baptist Church and it is located in San Francisco’s Chinatown. For the past 7 years, every summer I would work there as a camp counselor
          along with a bunch of other friends I have made in San Francisco. I honestly have a lot of fun and my job is to make sure the kids have a lot of fun. The last picture that is sort of faded out in the background is the hills of San Ramon. I
          faded it out and made sure that it covers most of my canvas because those hills represent my background and where I came from. The actual picture of the hills is from a trail I ran when I participated in my school’s cross country team. I
          think my image would look best either projected on a screen or printed on a large canvas.
